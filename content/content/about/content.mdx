Greetings! Welcome to Asian Christian Fellowship at the University of Toronto Scarborough Campus!



We are a student-based, student-run Christian fellowship, serving the community at UTSC from all denominations and walks of life. Although we mainly cater to the Asian population, we welcome those from all different ethnicities and cultural backgrounds.



Join us to learn more about Christ, strive to grow in faith, and be in community with fellow brothers and sisters.



For more updates and information, check out our fellowship on Facebook, Instagram, Discord, and Linktree!
