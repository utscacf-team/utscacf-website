Are you looking for a space to grow deeper in your faith and connect with your brothers & sisters? Join our small groups! Small groups are a way to intentionally meet with your brothers/sisters in Christ outside of our weekly ACF programs. It is focused on discipleship and living out our vision: **to grow in love for God and others**.
